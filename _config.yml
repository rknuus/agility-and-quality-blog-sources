# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Agile & Quality
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Agile development is awesome. Except when it's not. And quality is tricky,
  particularly in software development. This blog covers both topics, sometimes
  at the same time. Focusing on the positive side I won't rant a lot.
  Code is mainly in C++, Python, and occasionally Ruby. The articles are inspired
  by books, talks, and podcasts.
